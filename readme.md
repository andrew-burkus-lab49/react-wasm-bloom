BloomFilters are a cool example of an effective compromise in algorithm design: given a large set of values
we want to compute whether an arbitrary value is a member of that set. The problem here is that for very large sets
we will end up using an ungodly amount of memory to represent the set. 
If we used a hash set, it will likely be a 64 bit
hash for each record resulting in many MB used for just tens of thousands of records. 

This is where the compromise comes in, if we use a hashset we will get absolute certainty that any value we test 
against the set is a member or not. What if we didn't need to be absolutely certain? What if we could just be 99.999%
certain? That's the compromise. We'll trade absolute certainty for memory efficiency.

So, what is a BloomFilter? It's actually an incredibly simple idea which is what makes its efficacy so impressive.
At its core, it's an array of unsigned bytes and an algorithm for looking up addresses of a handful of bytes based
on a given value. Let's say we're given a value S, to lookup the bytes we want to check for S we hash it K number of times and then look those hashes up modulo the length of our byte array.
